# Earthquake

Vizualize earthquakes happening around the world. </br>
The data provided to us via the [US Geological Survey](https://earthquake.usgs.gov) and Streamlit is used to display everything.

## Goal

The goal of this project is two-fold:

- build a dataset from the data provided to us via [usgs](https://earthquake.usgs.gov)
- plot the data on a map
